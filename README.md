# web3-first-project

Web3 app made with react. Send transactions through the Ethereum Rapsten Test Network and check your latest.

## Installation

Navigate to `./client`

React has been designed for gradual adoption from the start, and **you can use as little or as much React as you need**:

* Use [Online Playgrounds](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html#online-playgrounds) to get a taste of React.
* [Add React to a Website](https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html) as a `<script>` tag in one minute.
* [Create a New React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) if you're looking for a powerful JavaScript toolchain.

You can use React as a `<script>` tag from a [CDN](https://reactjs.org/docs/cdn-links.html), or as a `react` package on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react).

## Usage

- Connect to web3 with using the metamask extension for your browser of choice. (https://metamask.io/)
- Enter the account to which you want to send the Ether
- Specify the amount
- (Optional) Add a message

After that you will be able to see the transaction in the main page.
